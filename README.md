This repository contains a simple Perl script demonstrating a common error related to comparing undefined variables ('undef') to strings using the 'eq' and 'ne' operators. The script showcases how undef values behave differently from other data types in string comparisons, often leading to unexpected results. A solution is also provided, explaining how to correctly handle such comparisons.
